**Thinking about leaving law enforcement? You aren’t alone.** In the last two months, I’ve had more cops than ever reach out asking how I made the transition from law enforcement to the private sector. It can be challenging - a recruiter once told me that no company wants to be the first to hire a candidate right out of law enforcement; too many don’t make a successful transition to the private sector. What can you do to improve your chances of landing and succeeding a private sector security role?


**Here’s my top five tips to help you successfully make the switch:**

1. **Plan ahead.** 
     Don’t wait until you are 20 years in to think about what you want to do next. Expand your skill set throughout your career.  Identify and work to fill gaps in your skills to make you a better candidate for future private sector roles. Take advantage of free training opportunities (OSHA, FEMA, etc) but also invest in your own development by completing industry certifications like [Certified Fraud Examiner](https://www.acfe.com/become-cfe-qualifications.aspx).  Volunteer for non-profits like [Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/) where you can gain additional training in crisis management, disaster recovery, and other skills while continuing to serve your community. 

     Building your knowledge base over several years will be significantly less stressful than cramming right before an interview for a new role, and you’ll be able to demonstrate your commitment to growth and development to future employers. 

2. **Think about what you want your next role to look like, and focus your job search on companies/roles that match.** 
     Do you want to work for a Fortune 500 or a start-up? In a more structured environment or one where you are “building the plane after take-off”? In a clearly defined role or would you rather be a jack-of-all-security-trades?

     Research and consider the culture of the company. Are you ready to attend the annual “summer camp” - three days sleeping in a tent with strangers in a field? Not something I ever thought I’d do (let alone twice) and would be a hard “nope” for plenty of folks!  If you’ve spent the last decade working plainclothes, do you want to wear a suit every day and go into an office?
 
     Taking a role that isn’t truly aligned with what you want to do, or with a company whose values significantly differ from your own, will lead to frustration and unhappiness. It’s a misstep that many folks transitioning from law enforcement make. Being intentional about what you want up front will save you time and energy, and lead to a better experience for you and your future employer in the long run.

3. **Identify which skills are transferable to the private sector, highlight them on your resume, and tailor your resume for each application.** 
     If you've succeeded in law enforcement, you know how to build relationships, how to verbal judo, and how to negotiate different points of view - all great skills!  Unless the role you are applying for requires it, a recruiter will be less impressed that you were a firearms instructor or wrote 500 citations a month. 

     Look online (Indeed.com has been a great resource for me) at private sector openings for the role you want. Get ideas on key skills, frequently sought characteristics, and see how they are described in those job postings. Build your resume and cover letter to suit each role, and figure out how to transfer all those soft skills you’ve mastered into bullet points that differentiate you from all the other “cop resumes.” 

4. **Build and maintain your network.** 
     In your current role, you have the opportunity to interact with people from a variety of industries. Ask questions about the security operations of different businesses and the skill sets required. If you are interested in securing educational institutions, talk to your local schools or colleges about their security operations. If you are a commercial vehicle inspector or accident reconstructionist, talk to companies about their fleet safety operations and risk management. 

     Much like law enforcement, the security industry is a small circle. If I’m not hiring, I probably know someone who is. Many of us have been in your shoes, needed a hand getting started, and are more than willing to pay it forward. Join groups like [ASIS](https://www.asisonline.org/) that offer networking opportunities as well as certifications. Attend the chapter meetings, introduce yourself, and ask questions. Beef up your LinkedIn profile. When you are ready to make the switch, get the word out! 

5. **Apply early and often.** 
     Companies receive dozens, if not hundreds, of applications as soon as a role is posted online. Sign up for alerts for job-posting websites like LinkedIn and Indeed so you are notified immediately when roles of interest pop up. Have a resume ready to quickly fine tune, and be one of the first to apply. If you can identify the recruiter or hiring manager, reach out and introduce yourself. I got my first private sector role partly because I reached out, introduced myself, and included a few lines about how I thought I could help with the company’s mission. That outreach may be what bumps your application to the top of the pile.

     Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get the first role (or dozens) that you apply for. It’s a competitive field. People move on to new roles much more often than in law enforcement. Keep refining your resume, expanding your skills, and building your network - you’ll get there!
